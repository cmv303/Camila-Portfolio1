# Camila's Coding Portfolio

Hello! This is my very first coding portfolio. While it still needs a lot of work,
I'm proud to show where I am three weeks into a coding bootcamp, having come
from absolutely zero prior coding knowledge.

The idea of this page is simple, and uses placeholder images for 
deployed coding applications (as I really don't have any yet), but
the hope is that as I evolve as a coder, this page can grow with me.


## Features
